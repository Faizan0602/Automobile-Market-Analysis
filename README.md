## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard includes:

- ✅ **KPI Cards**:
  - Total Cars: **1276**
  - Average Torque: **265.18 Nm**
  - Average Power: **156.15 HP**
  - Average Valves per Cylinder: **3.99**

- 📌 **Visual Insights**:
  - **Bar Charts** showing car counts and power by Make and Body Type
  - **Donut Chart** showing car distribution by Fuel Type
  - **Line Chart** mapping Fuel Type against Torque
  - **Clustered Column Chart** for Power distribution across car makes
  - **Displacement Summary** by car models
  - **Table View** of detailed car specifications

- 🧮 Filters & Interactivity:
  - Dynamic filters for Make, Body Type, and Fuel Type to explore specific segments of the dataset
